Cannot be empty, cannot be number/text, cannot be negative, cannot be spaces, cannot be spl. chars., minimum length, improper email format, min.-max. marks, out of range, already exists, invalid username, invalid password, min password length, username exists, email already exists etc.)
b. Share a screenwise/ pagewise list of input validations coded for each input field.
